                            </h3>
                            <p class="para-hack">
                                There are various definitions one can get to know about hackers. The term hacker was
                                used in the early 1990s and it was to describe someone who
                                <br> could be a great programmer and had the ability to solve complex problems. Now the
                                definition of the hacker changed from time to time as it started
                                <br> to gain a negative vibe by the media.

                                The media started to refer to this hacker as someone who finds loopholes and tries to
                                gain access into the system <br>to steal information that could be important for the
                                victims. This was the picture created by00000000000 the media to only show the negative
                                aspect,<br> but they didn’t show the positive aspect. The positive aspect was someone
                                who was exposing the vulnerabilities found in the system and protecting<br>
                                organizations and multiple users.

                                In short, we can define a hacker as someone who is able to be creative, solve problems
                                that can be complex, and<br>
                                more. Due to this reason, the term has been broken into three different categories.

                                <strong>TYPES OF HACKERS</strong>
                            </h3>
                            <ol>
                                <li> White Hat Hacker<br>
                                    They are the hackers referred to as security professionals. This type of hacker is
                                    employed by organizations, and they<br>
                                    are permitted to attack an organization. They can attack the organization because
                                    their main job is to find the vulnerabilities which can<br> be used by the attacker.
                                </li>
                                <li> Black Hat Hacker<br>
                                    They are one type of hackers who uses the knowledge for malicious purposes. They are
                                    someone whom we can call a<br>
                                    cracker. The way they use the knowledge is to gain access to the information of the
                                    user which might be dangerous for the victims.
                                </li>
                                <li>Gray Hat Hacker<br>
                                    They are the type of hacker who acts as both the white Hat Hacker and the Black Hat
                                    Hacker. For example:- A grey hat hacker can work as<br>
                                    a security profession for any organization and finds the vulnerabilities that still
                                    exist in the system. But they can leave a backdoor, by which<br>
                                    they can access and can sell confidential information to the competitors of a
                                    company.
